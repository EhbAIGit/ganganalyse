# ganganalyse van een persoon

* Data Capture: Using the RealSense 3D camera to capture video footage of a person walking. This camera can provide both visual and depth information, crucial for analyzing the three-dimensional aspects of the gait.

* Data Processing: The recorded data is then processed, which could involve steps like calibration (to ensure accurate measurements), extracting relevant frames, and possibly converting the data into a format suitable for analysis.

* Gait Analysis: This is the core part of the project, where algorithms analyze the gait characteristics. This could involve measuring stride length, speed, joint angles, and other biomechanical aspects of walking. The analysis might be done through image processing techniques, possibly involving machine learning or AI algorithms to identify and quantify specific gait parameters.

* Output: Finally, the analysis results could be presented in various forms, such as graphs, numerical data, or visual overlays on the video, to demonstrate the gait characteristics.

The project's Python scripts covers these different aspects, with each script handling specific tasks like video recording (record_video.py), calibration (calibrate.py), processing raw data (process.py), and analyzing the gait characteristics (analyse_file.py).
